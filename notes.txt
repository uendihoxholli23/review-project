## important git commands
git status 
git branch 
git diff
git fetch 
git pull 

## 1. simple way to push the data to the main branch 
git add .
git commit -m "add expressjs, save and get all reviews"
git push origin main  

--------------------------------------------
## (advanced git flow for future purposes) 
git checkout -b test/branch-and-pr-git-flow
git add .
git commit -m "test/branch-and-pr-git-flow"
git push origin test/branch-and-pr-git-flow

Making a validation system using Yup with expressjs
1.Yup is a schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation
-Installing dependencies 
-Creating a simple api in expressjs
-Creating a new route in our api, 
in which we'll return the object data from 
the http request body and we'll still return the id from the params.
-Creating middleware and add it to the route
---------------------------------------------
Express request object -> are used by the client to send data to the server.
1. ----- req.body -> Use it when you want to send sensitive data(eg. form data) or super long JSON data to the server.
(generally used in post/put)
2. ---- req.params -> properties attached to the url i.e named route parameters.
You prefix the parameter name with a colon(:) when writing your routes.

        Example:   

        app.get('/giraffe/:number', (req, res) => {
            console.log(req.params.number)
        })      // http://localhost:3000/giraffe/1

3. ---- req.qquery -> is mostly used for searching,sorting, filtering etc.
For example you want to query an API but only want to get data from page 10.

        Example: 
        
          app.get('/animals', ()=>{
            console.log(req.query.page) 
          })    // http://localhost:3000/animals?page=10



REcommendations:
Always try and catch async/await and print or return the errors 
Always validate the data comming from the client (in this case using yup)

TODO (26th July):
Try and catch for all the routes 
Add Yup validation for all the routes
